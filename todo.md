# TODOs

Here is a list of things that we need to do before the version 1.0.0, which will be the first
official release of the library. The code is already available on github at the following address:  
https://github.com/adriente/espm.git 
A draft of the documentation is available at: https://espm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

* Complete the general doc in `doc/introduction/index.rst` (@Adrien)
* Check that the doc is somehow understanable and sufficiently complete (@Sebastian)
* Add the reference to the dataset paper (@Nati) 
* add the reference to the algorithm paper (@Nati) 

@Adrien: Check the code in espm.weights. If you copy this code, you can generate figures for the doc. 
It seems that you need to have the title `Examples` for the system to work. `Example` does not work!
